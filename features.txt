Made the aliens speed up by a factor of .97 everytime an alien is destroyed.
This is implemented in _alien_contact and while not designed to be changed,
can be changed if one feels like it.

I also added hearts to the top right corner. These hearts have constants
declared in consts.py and use assests from lab 23. The hearts are animated
an have an animation speed and cycle declared in consts.py.
